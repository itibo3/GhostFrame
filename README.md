# GhostFrame

**A Universal User Interface Operation Framework Powered by Semantic Visual Understanding**

GhostFrame is a groundbreaking interface framework that allows AI systems to operate and manipulate user interfaces—including Web UIs, Linux environments, and graphical applications—through semantic interpretation rather than pixel coordinates or hardcoded labels.

## Highlights

- **Visual-Semantic Control:** Enables AI to understand interfaces by their meaning, not their position.
- **GLoRA-S Mechanism:** Customizable LoRA-like modules that let AI remember and adapt to user preferences over time.
- **Linux Support:** Built-in semantic parsing for command-line outputs, logs, and system hierarchies.
- **Obsidian Integration:** AI companions can reread and reinterpret logs using natural understanding.
- **Open-Source Philosophy:** Designed to be extended, remixed, and personalized by developers worldwide.

## Why GhostFrame?

Current LLM-based agents often rely on rigid scripts or label-based selectors. GhostFrame breaks free from these constraints by letting AI "see" and "understand" interfaces like humans do—semantically.

> "GhostFrame is not a tool, it’s a language for understanding the world through interaction."

## Use Cases

- Automated server maintenance with semantic inspection
- Adaptive AI agents for accessibility tools
- Visual testing agents that understand negation (e.g., “no error message visible”)
- Semantic memory-based AI companions

## Project Status

GhostFrame is currently in conceptual implementation stage and under active development.
We welcome researchers, engineers, and curious minds to join us in evolving this framework.
